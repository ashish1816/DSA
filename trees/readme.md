# Binary Trees

## Properties of binary trees:-

- The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is **2<sup>l</sup>**.
-  The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is **2<sup>h</sup>  – 1**.
- In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is **Log<sub>2</sub>(N+1)**.
- A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least **| Log<sub>2</sub>L |+ 1** levels.

## Tree Traversals:-
- **Preorder traversal**
- **Inorder traversal**
- **Postorder traversal**
